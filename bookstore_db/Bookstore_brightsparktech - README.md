# Bookstore Database Project - README

## Project Overview

In this project, our goal is to create a relational database for a bookstore using MySQL. The database will store information about books, authors, customers, orders, shipping, and more. The project is split into different tasks, with each team member taking responsibility for specific parts of the project. Below are the steps and responsibilities for each member.

## Project Tasks Breakdown

### Step 1: Database Creation
*Amany Nabil* will be responsible for creating the database. This includes setting up the MySQL database for the bookstore, defining the necessary tables, and ensuring that the database structure meets the project requirements.

### Step 2: Table Creation
*Amany Nabil* will also handle the creation of the tables within the MySQL database. This includes defining the schema and data types for each table according to the projectâ€™s requirements.

### Step 3: ERD Design (Entity Relationship Diagram)
*Neo Mokoele* will create the Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) using Draw.io. The ERD will visually represent the relationships between all the tables in the database, ensuring clarity and alignment with the MySQL design.

### Step 4: Relationship Verification
*Neo Mokoele* will verify the relationships between the tables, making sure that the connections in the ERD are accurate and reflect the actual relationships in the MySQL schema.

### Step 5: SQL Queries
*Nomakha Dlomo* will write the SQL queries needed to manipulate and populate the data in the tables. This will include inserting sample data and ensuring that queries return the correct results.

### Step 6: GitHub Upload
*Amany Nabil* will upload the completed project files (including the MySQL scripts, ERD, and SQL queries) to GitHub. This will ensure the project is accessible and can be easily shared with others.

## Expected Outcomes

By the end of this project, we will have:

- A fully functional MySQL database to manage the bookstore's data.
- An accurate ERD representing the relationships between all tables.
- A set of SQL queries that populate and manipulate the data effectively.
- The entire project uploaded to GitHub for easy access and sharing.

## Tools and Technologies Used

- *MySQL*: For creating and managing the database.
- *Draw.io*: For designing the ERD.
- *GitHub*: For storing and sharing the project files.
